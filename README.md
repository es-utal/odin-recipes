# The Odin Project - First Project

This is the first project in The Odin Project curriculum. In this project, I have created simple HTML pages utilizing fundamental concepts, such as:

- Lists
- Images
- Links
- Text Formatting

These elements were incorporated to build a basic understanding of HTML structure and layout.
